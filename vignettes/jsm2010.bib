title = {A comprehensive evaluation of SNP genotype imputation},
abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have contributed significantly to the genetic dissection of complex diseases. In order to increase the power of existing marker sets even further, methods have been proposed to predict individual genotypes at un-typed loci from other marker sets by imputation, usually employing HapMap data as a reference. Although various imputation algorithms have been used in practice already, a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of these approaches, using genome-wide SNP data from one and the same population is still lacking. We therefore investigated four publicly available programs for genotype imputation (BEAGLE, IMPUTE, MACH, and PLINK) using data from 449 German individuals genotyped in our laboratory for three genome-wide SNP sets [Affymetrix 5.0 (500 k), Affymetrix 6.0 (1,000 k), and Illumina 550 k]. We observed that HapMap-based imputation in a northern European population is powerful and reliable, even in highly variable genomic regions such as the extended MHC on chromosome 6p21. However, while genotype predictions were found to be highly accurate with all four programs, the number of SNPs for which imputation was actually carried out ('imputation efficacy') varied substantially. BEAGLE, IMPUTE, and MACH yielded nearly identical trade-offs between imputation accuracy and efficacy whereas PLINK performed consistently poorer. We nevertheless recommend either MACH or BEAGLE for practical use because these two programs are more user-friendly and generally require less memory than IMPUTE.},

journal = {PLoS Genet},
title = {Imputation-based analysis of association studies: candidate regions and quantitative traits},
abstract = {We introduce a new framework for the analysis of association studies, designed to allow untyped variants to be more effectively and directly tested for association with a phenotype. The idea is to combine knowledge on patterns of correlation among SNPs (e.g., from the International HapMap project or resequencing data in a candidate region of interest) with genotype data at tag SNPs collected on a phenotyped study sample, to estimate ("impute") unmeasured genotypes, and then assess association between the phenotype and these estimated genotypes. Compared with standard single-SNP tests, this approach results in increased power to detect association, even in cases in which the causal variant is typed, with the greatest gain occurring when multiple causal variants are present. It also provides more interpretable explanations for observed associations, including assessing, for each SNP, the strength of the evidence that it (rather than another correlated SNP) is causal. Although we focus on association studies with quantitative phenotype and a relatively restricted region (e.g., a candidate gene), the framework is applicable and computationally practical for whole genome association studies. Methods described here are implemented in a software package, Bim-Bam, available from the Stephens Lab website http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/software.html.},

title = {A new multipoint method for genome-wide association studies by imputation of genotypes},
abstract = {Genome-wide association studies are set to become the method of choice for uncovering the genetic basis of human diseases. A central challenge in this area is the development of powerful multipoint methods that can detect causal variants that have not been directly genotyped. We propose a coherent analysis framework that treats the problem as one involving missing or uncertain genotypes. Central to our approach is a model-based imputation method for inferring genotypes at observed or unobserved SNPs, leading to improved power over existing methods for multipoint association mapping. Using real genome-wide association study data, we show that our approach (i) is accurate and well calibrated, (ii) provides detailed views of associated regions that facilitate follow-up studies and (iii) can be used to validate and correct data at genotyped markers. A notable future use of our method will be to boost power by combining data from genome-wide scans that use different SNP sets.},

journal = {Hum Hered},
title = {An R package for analysis of whole-genome association studies},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To provide data classes and methods to facilitate the analysis of whole genome association studies in the R language for statistical computing. METHODS: We have implemented data classes in which each genotype call is stored as a single byte. At this density, data for single chromosomes derived from large studies and new high-throughput gene chip platforms can be handled in memory. We use the object-oriented programming model introduced with version 4 of the S-plus package, usually termed 'S4 methods'. RESULTS: At the current state of development the package only supports population-based studies, although we would hope to provide support for family-based studies soon. Both quantitative and qualitative phenotypes may be analysed. Flexible association testing functions are provided which can carry out single SNP tests which control for potential confounding by quantitative and qualitative covariates. Tests involving several SNPs taken together as 'tags' are also supported. Efficient calculation of pair-wise linkage disequilibrium measures is implemented and data input functions include a function which can download data directly from the international HapMap project website.},

journal = {Hum Hered},
title = {Detecting disease associations due to linkage disequilibrium using haplotype tags: a class of tests and the determinants of statistical power},
abstract = {In the 'indirect' method of detecting genetic associations between a trait and a DNA variant, we type several markers in a gene or chromosome region of linkage disequilibrium. If there is association between markers and the trait, we presume the existence of one or more causal polymorphisms in the region. In order to obtain a sufficiently dense set of markers it will almost always be necessary to use single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Although there is an emerging literature on methods for choosing an optimal set of 'haplotype tag SNPs' (htSNPs) to detect association between a genetic region and a trait, less attention has been given to the problem of how such studies should be analysed when completed, and how the initial data which was used to select the htSNPs should be incorporated into the analysis. This paper discusses this problem for both population- and family-based association studies. The role of the R2 measure of association between a causal locus and various methods of scoring of marker haplotypes is highlighted. In most cases, the simplest method of scoring (locus coding), which does not require phase resolution, is shown generally to be more powerful than scoring methods that include haplotype information. A new 'multi-locus TDT' is also proposed.},
